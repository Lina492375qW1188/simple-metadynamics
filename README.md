# simple-metadynamics

This is a demonstration of a simple 1-dimensional metadynamics. It is built with some basic numpy to make the code cleaner and matplotlib for visualization.

## Structure

`DATA/` saves the trajectories. 

`output/` saves the `gif`. These gif can be used in presentation.

`md.ipynb` shows the normal md without metadynamics. This is for comparing later with metadynamics results. 

`metad_sigma.ipynb` shows the performance of metadynamics under various Gaussian width. 

`swim.py` is a module for md and metadynamics code.
